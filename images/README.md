# seed-emulator images

These images can be used as a pre-built base for emulations.

They contain software needed for various seed layers, but do not contain configuration files pertinent to a specific experiment.

To build an image, use the ```build_image.sh``` script.
Running:
```bash
./build_image.sh
```
will show usage instructions.
